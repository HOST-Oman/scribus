==============================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scribusproject/scribus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scribusproject/scribus) [![Coverity Scan Build Status](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/216/badge.svg)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/scribus)

## Status
Here we implement features that we love to see it in upstream version of Scribus because we use Scribus 1.5 in production mainly in typesetting Arabic books.

This README.md file is geared toward the Scribus github repository which serves as a mirror for the Scribus Subversion repository `svn://scribus.net/trunk/Scribus`.
The Scribus development team prefer svn over git and recommend you also use the public subversion repository at svn://scribus.net.
This mirror is updated manually and is not supported by the Scribus team - for any issues, we will request you  get the source from subversion before submitting bugs etc.

Complex text layout features available right now:
- support RTL languages (Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Hebrew).
- support Bi-directional text.
- support Indic Scripts and Languages.
- support more than 500 languages.
- support OpenType Font Features.
- allow customization of hyphenation character
- add ability to link selected text frames directly
- Support RTL binding layout.

General Features:
- Search \ replace all text frames
