[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HOST-Oman/scribus.svg?branch=ctl)](https://travis-ci.org/HOST-Oman/scribus) [![Coverity Scan Build Status](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/216/badge.svg)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/scribus)

## Status
This README.md file is geared toward the Scribus github repository which serves as a mirror for the Scribus Subversion repository `svn://scribus.net/trunk/Scribus`. The Scribus development team prefer svn over git. This mirror is updated manually.

## Download
Each build from Travis CI is available for download as an [AppImage](Http://appimage.org) for 64-bit Linux. You can find the download link in the Travis CI [build log](https://travis-ci.org/HOST-Oman/scribus). Towords the end of the log file, look for a line with an URL that begins with with `https://transfer.sh/`. This is the download link. Download the AppImage, [make it executable](http://discourse.appimage.org/t/how-to-make-an-appimage-executable/80), and run. No root, no installation, does not touch any of the libaries on your system, can run alongside other versions you might already have.
