<h2>Working with Frames</h2>

<p>Working with Scribus is for the most part working with a frames
environment. Some more generic terms you may see in menus and commands
are objects or items, of which frames are one kind of object or item.
There are five kinds of frames you will work with in Scribus:
</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="WwText.html">Text frames</a></li>
  <li><a href="WwImages.html">Image frames</a></li>
  <li><a href="WwRenderframes.html">Render frames</a></li>
  <li><a href="WwShapes.html">Shapes</a></li>
  <li><a href="WwShapes.html">Polygons</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these have their own section in this online manual, but here we
will explain features they share.</p>
<h3>Creating Frames</h3>
<p>There are at least seven ways to create frames:</p>
<ol>

  <li>Clicking the toolbar icon for the type of frame</li>
  <li>Choosing from the menu, <span style="font-style: italic;">Insert</span>&nbsp;&gt; <i>Type of frame</i></li>
  <li>Choosing from the menu, <span style="font-style: italic;">Insert</span>&nbsp;&gt; <i>Frames...</i> for text and image frames (see below)</li>
  <li>Using the keyboard shortcut (when not in Edit Contents mode in an
already existing frame)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>T for Text frame</li>
    <li>I for Image frame</li>
    <li>D for Render frame</li>
    <li>S for Shape</li>
    <li>P for Polygon</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Using Duplicate or Multiple Duplicate to make one or more copies
of the selected frame</li>
  <li>Duplicating a Layer with its contents</li>
  <li>Copying a page, with all of its contents</li>
</ol>

<table cellpadding="5" width="70%">

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><p>If you change your mind or pressed the wrong key
(at least in the cases 1, 2 and 3),
you can press Esc or the Spacebar to cancel, or click the toolbar icon
for your next choice.</p>
      <p>When you make one of the choices 1&ndash;3, your mouse cursor
becomes activated to draw the frame, and a tooltip pops up to tell you
the cursor&rsquo;s X-Pos and Y-Pos. As you click-drag to make the frame from
one corner to its opposite, the tooltip now displays the Width and
Height frame you are creating. For Shapes and Polygons, this describes
the dimensions of the Bounding Box. </p>
      <p>Usually the next step is adding or doing something with the
content, but we will leave that to the individual sections regarding
each type of frame.</p>
      </td>
      <td width="310"><img src="images/shapes7.png">
      <p>Here we see the <b>Enter Object Size</b> dialog that comes up
if you left-click somewhere on the page, rather than doing a click-drag
operation. Obviously this can be very handy for creating a frame of a
precise size.</p>
      <p>The fields <span style="font-style: italic;">Width</span> and
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Height</span> are spinboxes
whose use will be explained below.<br>
      </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<h3>Insert > Frames...</h3>
<p>This is a special method for creating text or image frames, which adds the ability to create one or multiple frames with predetermined features, and even predetermined content.</p>
<p><img src="images/insertframes.png"><img src="images/insertframes1.png"></p>
<p>The <b>Location</b> tab is identical for both types of frame, giving these choices for how many pages should get the new frame, and specifications for position.</p>
<p><img src="images/insertframes2.png"></p>
<p>The <b>Size</b> tab is almost identical for each, with the only difference being an additional choice for image frames dependent on the size of the image, as seen here.</p>
<img src="images/insertframes3.png"></p>
<p><b>Options</b> for text frames are several, allowing for creating columns with adjustable gap, linking frames if there are more than one, or even linking from an already existing frame.<br />The <b>Source Document</b> can be any of the types of text files that Scribus can import.</p>

<p><img src="images/insertframes4.png"></p>
<p>With image frames, your only choice under <b>Options</b> will be the <b>Source Image</b> for your frames. There is only one image file which you can choose, so if you are creating multiple frames, they will all have the same content.<br />Something else to remember is that unless you have set image frames to automatically adjust image to frame (this is in Preferences > Item Tools > Images), this may need to be adjusted frame by frame after creation.</p>
<h3>Shift-Click Frame Creation</h3>
<p>There is also a useful timesaving feature by holding down <b>Shift</b> while left-clicking on the page (after you have clicked the appropriate tool on the toolbar, or used the corresponding keyboard shortcut). This will create a frame filling to the borders of the space in which you click. These borders might be the margins if there are no guides, but if there are guides, the frame will fill to the nearest margin or guide in all four directions. The grid has no impact on this sort of frame creation. Check to see what happens when you click outside the margins.</p>

<p><img src="images/wwframes_fillspace.png"></p>


<h3>Context Menus</h3>
<p>Each frame type has its own particular Context Menu, found by
right-clicking on it. Since these are variable depending on the type of
frame, they will not be elaborated upon here. Keep in mind that you can
find interesting things in Scribus by right-clicking on various items.</p>
<h3>Manipulating Frames</h3>

<h4>How to Use Spinboxes</h4>

<table>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Hover the cursor over the spinbox value and use your
mousewheel to change it</li>
        <li>Click the up or down arrow to the right side of the spinbox</li>
        <li>Use the arrow keys &ndash; cursor must be over the appropriate
spinbox</li>
        <li>Change the value with the keyboard. <br>
          <i>Hint: Scribus will do math for you. Enter (615/2+20), for
example. There are some keywords you can use also, and combine with
math operations: <b>pagewidth</b>/2, for example. Other keywords are <b>pageheight</b>,
          <b>width</b> (of selected item), and <b>height</b> (of
selected item).</i> </li>
      </ul>
<p>The mousewheel digit changed can be modified:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No key pressed: units</li>
        <li>Shift key held: tenths</li>
        <li>Shift + Alt: hundredths</li>
        <li>Ctrl or Alt: tens</li>
        <li>Ctrl + Alt: hundreds &ndash; <i>Careful with this one with a
page measurement unit like inches</i></li>
        <li>Except for those that use Alt, you can use most of these
keymods when moving the frame with the arrow keys (cursor not over
spinbox), but not for resizing with arrow keys.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Moving Frames</h4>
      <p>The simplest method is to click-hold inside the frame and move
with the mouse. While this is taking place a tooltip tells you the
position of the <b>Basepoint</b> (default basepoint is left upper
corner). You can also use the arrow keys to move the frame as long as
the cursor is not over any spinboxes. For more precise movement, use <span style="font-style: italic;">Properties&nbsp;&gt; X,Y,Z</span>
tab (<b>X-Pos</b> and <b>Y-Pos</b>) and its
spinboxes. </p>
      <h4>Resizing Frames</h4>
<p>A selected frame shows a dotted red border and in addition small square
handles at the corners and at the midpoints of each side. Click and
drag a handle to make manual adjustments. If you hold down the Alt key <i>and
the cursor is not over a spinbox</i>, you can resize the frame using
the arrow keys. To resize a frame proportionally, press Ctrl+Alt while
moving a handle. Use the <b>Width</b> and <b>Height</b> spinboxes in
the Properties Palette for
precision.</p> </td>
      <td valign="middle"><img src="images/XYZ_Prop.png"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Rotating Frames</h4>
<p>There are 2 ways to rotate a frame:</p>
<ul>

  <li>Click the Rotate icon on the toolbar. You then click-drag inside
the frame to rotate. As long as you click inside a frame, the basepoint
is always the center of the frame. However, if click on any of the
corner handles, the basepoint is the opposite corner.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Use the <b>Rotation</b> spinbox in Properties. In this case, you
can choose the <b>basepoint</b> around which rotation takes place, as
well as have more precision.</li>
</ul>

<table>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <h4>Moving Frames &ndash; Level to Level or Layer to Layer</h4>
<p>You can move up or down levels using Properties&nbsp;&gt; X,Y,Z tab, in the
area labelled <b>Level</b>, either one level at a time or to the top
or bottom. The number beside these arrows tells you which level your
object is on (1 is the bottom).</p>
      <p>There are also keyboard shortcuts: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Home: to the top</li>
        <li>End: to the bottom</li>
        <li>Ctrl+Home: up one level</li>
        <li>Ctrl+End: down one level</li>
      </ul>
<p>If you have more than one <a href="layers.html">layer</a>, you can use the Context Menu
(right-click on the frame) to send the frame to a different layer.</p>
      <h4>Final Section of Properties: X,Y,Z</h4>
<p>Looking at the last group of seven buttons in the lower right corner of <b>X,Y,Z</b>,
the two leftmost buttons, grayed out in this picture, will group and
ungroup a collection of selected objects (note that vector drawings are <span style="font-style: italic;">always</span> imported as groups of objects). The next two buttons, with
the arrows, flip the object horizontally or vertically. The
picture of the lock is where you can lock or unlock the selected
object, and just to its right you can lock or unlock only the size of
the object. The last button in the lower right corner enables is
disables printing (and export to PDF) of the object.</p> </td>
      <td valign="middle"><img src="images/XYZ_Prop1.png"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Copy, Cut, Paste, Delete</h4>
<p>Most users should be familiar with these kinds of operations common to
many types of editing software. They can be found in the Context Menu or the <span style="font-style: italic;">Edit</span> menu,
and have the standard keyboard shortcuts of Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X, Ctrl+V, and
Del. In Scribus, Delete operates similar to Cut, since it can be undone, but
in contrast is not copied to the clipboard and therefore cannot be
pasted. If you move from one page or one layer to another, Paste will
place the new copy at the same coordinates it had on the original page
or layer.</p>
<h4>Selecting Multiple Frames</h4>
<p>You might do this as a prelude to grouping the frames, so you can move
or scale them as a unit.</p>
<p>The simplest way of selecting a group of frames is to click-drag <i>around</i>
them. You have to be sure that any frame you wish to be selected is
<span style="font-style: italic;">fully</span> within the temporary rectangle you see during this operation.
This may not work when you only want some of the frames in a particular
rectangular space. In that situation you can manually select additional
frames in a cumulative way by holding down Shift as you click. If you
make a mistake, click again while holding Shift to deselect individual
frames. If you have
not yet grouped the frames, click outside these collectively selected
frames to &ldquo;break&rdquo; the multiple selection. You can also combine these
approaches by click-dragging around a number of frames, then
Shift-clicking any you wish to select in addition or deselect.
</p>

<h4>Selecting Frames Under Other Frames</h4>
<p>If all you want to do is select an individual frame that happens to be
completely underneath some other frame, hold Shift+Ctrl, and click
serially on a particular spot to toggle through the frames covering
that spot. You will cycle through the frames, but also at some point
select none of them.</p>
<p><i>Note: if you find an inability to select a frame underneath
another using this method, consider that this frame may be on another
layer. You may only work on one layer at a time.</i>
</p>

<h3>Line and Colors of Frames</h3>
<p>The line of a frame is the border. For text, image and render frames, the
default color of the line is None, so none of the line settings have
any meaning until the line is given a color in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Colors</span> tab of the Properties Palette. The
default background or fill color of text and image frames is also None.
<br>
<br>
For Shapes and Polygons, the default fill color is set to None, whereas the default line color is Black. For all
kinds of frames these default colors can be set in <span style="font-style: italic;">File &gt; Document Setup &gt; Tools</span> for the current document and in <span style="font-style: italic;">File &gt;
Preferences &gt; Tools</span> for new documents.</p>
<h3>Text Flow Around Frame</h3>

<table cellpadding="5">

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><p>The first important thing to remember is that this can be a
property of any kind of frame, and that it applies to any text frames <i>underneath</i>
it, underneath being not only on a lower level, but also a lower layer.</p>
      <p>Secondly, you need to choose whether you want flow around the
frame, the contour line, or the bounding box – making your choice in
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Shape</span> tab of Properties. For text and image frames, all 3 coincide
with each other when they are created. <br>
</p>
      <p>As for shapes and polygons, only the frame and
contour lines coincide (i.e., they are identical with the shape/polygon
itself), whereas the bounding box is always the surrounding rectangle.
Details will be found in <a href="WwShapes.html">Working with Shapes</a>, but in the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Shape</span> tab of the Properties Palette you can edit the frame/shape or the contour line
independently. </p>

      <p>In this screenshot below, the left column flows around the
frame, the right around an edited (enlarged) contour line: </p>
      </td>
