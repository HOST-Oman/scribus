<h2>XnView</h2>
<p>There are image previewers and thumbnailing applications galore – even Konqueror and Nautilus have some of these features, so why should anyone use XnView?</p>


<p>It’s ugly. It uses old, Motif-like libraries, but it has two very redeeming qualities: </p>
<ol><li>It’s very fast, faster than most similar programs. </li>
<li>It handles a wide array of image formats with very good conversion capabilities. There are some real obscure file formats XnView can open and convert. It’s probable that only ImageMagick can handle more. It’s very stable and worth at least considering for your toolbox.</li></ol>
