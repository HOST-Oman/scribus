<h2>Scribus on Haiku</h2>

<p>Thanks to the efforts of Giovanni Mugnai, Scribus is also available for <a href="https://www.haiku-os.org/">Haiku</a>.</p>

<p>To run Scribus on Haiku you need to <a href="http://haikuware.com/directory/view-details/productivity/desktop-publishing/scribus-publishing-and-layout">download</a> Scribus for Haiku, which comes in a ZIP archive. Extract the archive to wherever you like (for example your desktop), then double-click the installer file <code>Scribus1.4.3_Haiku.pkg</code> and click on “Install.” The installer includes all dependencies. It also contains the latest versions of Ghostscript, Ghostscript fonts, LittleCMS and Hunspell, so these need not be installed separately.</p>

<p>After installation, an icon/link to Scribus will be present on the Desktop, and you can launch Scribus.</p>

<h3>Предостережения</h3>

<ul>
<li>Since CUPS hasn’t been ported to Haiku yet, you can’t print directly from Scribus. You can, however, export a PDF and print from BePDF or DocumentViewer.</li>

<li>The Scripter doesn’t work, because Tkinter is not yet available for Haiku.</li>

<li>The Properties Palette may be placed in the upper left of the screen without any obvious option to make it fully visible. Use Ctrl+Alt+Left mouse button to drag it to an appropriate position.</li>
