<h2>Scripter: Extension Scripts</h2>

<p>Author: Craig Ringer</p>

<p>The Scribus Python plugin offers some additional features for
extending Scribus with new capabilities and features, as opposed
to automating tasks. In particular, it is possible to use 'extension scripts'
to create new palettes and dockable windoes that can be used just like
they were a part of Scribus.</p>

<h3>Extension scripts</h3>

<p>Extension scripts are mostly like normal Python scripts for Scribus.
They're written somewhat differently so that they can be run with the
"extension script" feature, giving them access to PyQt support and
some other special features of the scripter. The most fundamental
differences between normal scripts and extensions scripts are that:
</p>

<ul>

	<li>Extension scripts can create Python objects that continue to exist
	after the script exits. Objects will only continue to exist if a reference
	to them still exists, most commonly because there's a name in the global
	namespace that refers to them. This means that Python functions can be
	called by Scribus - for example, as PyQt slots, or as callback functions on
	an event.</li>

	<li>Extension scripts can create code that runs without blocking the
	execution of scribus, so you can create floating palettes that can be
	present while the user works normally with Scribus (ie non-modal
	palettes).</li>

	<li>PyQt works correctly in extension scripts, unlike normal scipts.</li>

	<li>Extension scripts can make changes to the Python environment that will
	affect scripts run after it. Modules imported by one script can be seen by
	another, settings changed by one may stay changed, etc. This means you have
	to be somewhat more careful when writing extension scripts. In particular,
	global names bound by one extension script can be overwritten by another,
	causing the objects associated with those names to be cleaned up by the
	interpreter. In other words, you can have name conflicts and interactions
	between scripts, which you can't with normal scripts.</li>

</ul>

<h4>The technical bit</h4>

<p>Normal scripts get run in a new Python sub-interepter that's used just for
that script then cleaned up. This means that whatever Python objects they
create and whatever Python settings they change get automatically reset when
the script exits. Because Scribus takes care of cleaning up your script, you
don't have to worry about memory, conflicting with other scripts, etc and can
just get on with the business of writing the script.</p>

<p>Extension scripts, by contrast, are run in a single Python interpreter that
is started up when the script plugin loads. This interpreter keeps on running
until the script plugin is unloaded when Scribus quits. When Scribus runs an
extension script, it loads it into the running interpreter - much like
<code>execfile</code> loads a Python script in another Python script. This lets
extension scripts create new objects as they run, then exit to return control
to Scribus without having the objects they created destroyed. If another script
is then run, it can see all the objects created by the first script.</p>

<p>There are several situations where being able to create objects from Python
that hang around after the script exits is useful. The most significant is
graphical programming with PyQt, where PyQt objects are created when the script
runs and become functional only after the script exits, returning control to
the Scribus event loop. Another possible use is for macros, event callbacks,
and timers, where Scribus would need to be able to call Python code. You can
do all these with PyQt right now, but there is no direct support for timers
and callbacks in Scribus yet.</p>

<p>There are some downsides to having objects persist after the script exits.
Scripts can potentially interact in ways not thought of by their authors, which
is often good but can also cause unexpected and surprising bugs. Script authors
must also consider the effect of their code on the memory consumption of
Scribus.<p>

<h4>Building graphical add-ons in Python</h4>

<p>Building new palettes and dialogs in PyQt is a fairly easy way to
extend Scribus's user interface and provide extra facilities for
advanced scripts. Python is well suited to getting data into and out of
databases, content management systems, and other external repositories,
and being able to build your own interfaces for this can be very
helpful.</p>

<p>In most ways, PyQt works the same when running within Scribus as it
does when used in a stand-alone Python interpreter. There are
differences, however, and it is important to understand these.</p>

<ul>

    <li>An instance of <code>QApplication</code> already exists, and attempting
    to create one will have undesired consequences. You can access the existing
    <code>QApplication</code> instance as <code>qt.qApp</code> if you need
    it.</li>

    <li>Scribus runs the Qt event loop. Entering the Qt event loop in PyQt will
    probably prevent further execution of Scribus until your code exists, and
    may have other undesired behaviour. The following documentation will cover
    the correct approach to integrating your code into the event loop. In
    brief, however, you simply create all your instances, show your windows,
    and let your script exit. Qt will automatically integrate your windows into
    its event loop and everything will "just work" - even Python slots and
    Python widgets. In general, anything you want to keep around should be put
    in the global namespace (as explained above). </li>

</ul>

<h4>The Basics - Converting Hello World</h4>

<p>The first PyQt tutorial is the classic Hello World application. As
an example of the differences between PyQt and Scribus, we'll convert
that program to run in Scribus. Here's the original:</p>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
import qt

a = qt.QApplication(sys.argv)

hello = qt.QPushButton("Hello world!", None)
hello.resize(100, 30)

a.setMainWidget(hello)
hello.show()
sys.exit(a.exec_loop())
</pre>

<p>First, we need to disable the creation of <code>QApplication</code> since in
Scribus a <code>QApplication</code> instance already exists, and only one is
allowed per application. PyQt provides us with access to the
<code>QApplication</code> that was created by Scribus when it starts up as
<code>qt.qApp</code>. So, we simply replace:</p>

<pre>
a = qt.QApplication(sys.argv)
</pre>

<p>with</p>

<pre>
a = qt.qApp
</pre>

<p>and we're done with that change.</p>

<p>Next, we need to prevent the script from trying to run its own event
loop. Because Scribus has an event loop, if the script starts its own
it will disrupt Scribus until it exits. Qt is smart enough to hook any
windows you create into the existing event loop, so there's not much to
do. While your script is running, Scribus is under the control of
Python, so what we need to do is do all our setup (in this case, create
a simple window and show it) but then <i>let our script exit</i>
instead of running the event loop. Because all extension scripts run in
the same Python interpreter, the objects you create are not destroyed
when your script exits. It's a bit like loading a module. When your
script exists, Scribus takes control and resumes running the Qt event
loop. Because your windows are Qt widgets, the Scribus event loop looks
after them and they work like a normal part of Scribus. When a Python
slot is triggered or a Python function is called, PyQt automatically
takes care of running the Python function then returning to Scribus.</p>

<p>The only hitch with this scheme is that when your script terminates, all
objects you create inside a function or other local scope will be cleaned up by
Python as the scope is left (eg when leaving main()). This means that you need
to keep a reference to everything at the global level so that it's not cleaned
up. Support for PyQt in Scribus is very new, and there's no clear "right" way
to do this yet. Options
include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Creating everything you want to keep in the global namespace. Caution
    is required if your script is run multiple times.</li>

    <li>Storing objects you wish to keep in a dictionary or class in the global
    namespace. Most of the same problems exist with this as with storing the
    objects directly as global names.</li>

    <li>Putting your script in a module, then having the script the user runs
    simply import the module and run a function in it. This looks like it'll be
    the favoured approach. Note that the module body is not reloaded with every
    import, so you should generally put any code you want run each time in a
    function inside the module instead of the module top level. Alternately, you
    could check if the module is already loaded and reload() it instead of
    importing it anew.</li>
</ul>

<p>For now, because this script already creates everything as a global
we're going to do things that way. Larger scripts should be written as
modules.</p>

<p>Given that the objects we need will already hang around when the
script exits, all we need to do is prevent the script from entering the
event loop. That's easy - just comment out the last line:</p>

<pre>
# sys.exit(a.exec_loop())
</pre>

<p>and we're nearly done. The script will run now, but when you
close it it'll have a rather unintended effect - it'll close down
Scribus. That's probably not what you want. This happens because a Qt
application normally exits when its main widget ('main window') is
closed. We call <code>qt.setMainWidget(...)</code> to make our new window the
main widget, so when it's closed, Scribus goes with it. To prevent this, just
comment out <code>qt.setMainWidget</code>.</p>

<p>The new script looks like:</p>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
import qt

a = qt.qApp

hello = qt.QPushButton("Hello world!", None)
hello.resize(100, 30)

#a.setMainWidget(hello)
hello.show()
#sys.exit(a.exec_loop())
</pre>

<p>You'll find that script already saved as <code>pyqt_tut1.py</code> in the
scripter examples directory. Try running it as an extension script. You should
get a hello world button. Notice that you can keep working in Scribus as normal
while it's there, and that when you close the hello world window it politely
goes away without affecting Scribus.</p>

<p>If you have a look at the sample copy of this tutorial script,
you'll notice it has a few small additions. They are accompanied
by some explanatory comments, so they won't be explored more here.</p>

<h4>Fun with global names and shared interpreters</h4>

<p>You may remember that I mentioned 'issues' with storing objects you
want to keep as globals earlier? Unsurprisingly, I was dodging
something I didn't want to have to explain right away.</p>

<p>Storing objects as global names works fine ... until the user runs
your script again, or runs another script that uses the same names.
Python uses reference counting - an object continues to exist while one
or more names refer to it. When the global name you created earlier is
overwritten by another script or by another run of your script, there
are no more references to that object (which might be a window the user
is still using). Python does its job and helpfully deletes it for you -
it doesn't know it might still be being displayed, or might be a slot
that one of your windows is using. In many cases this will simply result
in a window unexpectedly vanishing, but it can have nastier consequences
too.</p>

<p>Try this now. Run the hello world script (using "Load Extension
Script...") and without closing the "Hello world" window, run the
script again. The original window should vanish and be replaced with
the new one.</p>

<p>There aren't really any good solutions to this yet, and the right
behaviour depends on what exactly you want to do. I'd like to have some
clearer recommendations to give, but for that I need use cases. If
you're running into this issue, please post a description of your
project on the Scribus mailing list and I or someone else will try to
give you a few suggestions.</p>

<p>The best solution so far is to use a simple wrapper script to run
your script and put your real script in a module. The wrapper script
imports your module then runs a function from the module to show the
windows. Since the module is only run the first time it's imported, the
window(s) will be displayed if they're not already visible, but won't
be disrupted if they are still visible. You can reload() the module
if you really want to re-run it, possibly after running some
cleanup code.</p>

<p>Better suggestions would be much appreciated. Feel free to post questions
and ideas on the mailing list.</p>

<h4>Other tricks</h4>

<p>Even if you're not building a custom graphical user interface, it's
possible to make use of extension scripts. For example, you can use
PyQt to run a function on a timer. One use might be to check for
updates to an article in a database and perhaps ask the user if they
wish to update their document with the new text (or see the
differences). You can find a very simple example of setting up a timer
with PyQt in the examples directory, called <code>pyqt_timer.py</code>.</p>

<p>Another idea, as suggested by someone on the mailing list, was to
write an XML-RPC server to expose the scripter API to external
programs. This should be possible by using the PyQt classes for
networking and event handling.</p>

<h3>Cleanly handling being run outside Scribus</h3>

<pre>
try:
    import scribus
except ImportError:
    print "This script can only be run as an extension script from Scribus"
    sys.exit(1)
</pre>

<p>This tries to load the Scribus scripter interface, and if it fails
assumes it is not running under Scribus and complains. It's a good idea
to do this in all your scripts so that you don't confuse users who try
to run them with the standalone Python interpreter. Try running the
script with <code>python pyqt_tut1.py</code> and note how it tells the user why
it won't work then exits. This is much nicer than an import error or bizarre
behaviour.</p>

<h3>Unanswered questions and missing features</h3>

<p>Support for extending Scribus from Python is still very much a work
in progress. Lots works fine, but there are lots of unexplored corners.
Feedback, suggestions, requests, ideas and offers of help would be much
appreciated and can be directed to the mailing list or to the author(s)
of this document.</p>

<p>Note that in particular there is no support for:
</p><ul>
	<li>Using PyQt from normal scripts (as opposed to extension scripts)</li>
	<li>Using PyGtk or wxPython</li>
	<li>Threading (PyQt threads might work within the limits of Qt's threading support)</li>
	<li>Hooking into the right-click menu (yet!)</li>
	<li>Triggering scripts on certain events (being considered)</li>
	<li>Easily and reliably hooking into the menus</li>
	<li>Extending Scribus dialogs</li>
	<li>Using Scribus custom widgets and classes</li>
	<li>Anything that requires you to hand over control to its event loop without returning (these will work, but block Scribus).</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these are just not done yet, some are extremely difficult, and some
we don't know how to do at all or don't plan to attempt.</p>
