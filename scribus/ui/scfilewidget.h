/*! \brief Simple wrapper simulating the QFileDialog as a common widget.
Usage is simple - everything is like in QFileDialog except it is not
a dialog, it's a widget. It can be used for extension features etc.
\note Original QFileDialog OK/Cancel buttons are hidden. You must
write your own dialog accept/reject handling.
There is one good idea - it's quite good to handle original dialog
accepted() signal on your own to prevent ugly widget hidding when
user e.g. doubleclicks the "open" file (in the parent (new) dialog):
connect(fileWidget, SIGNAL(accepted()), this, SLOT(accept()));
